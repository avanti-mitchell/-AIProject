Import Necessary Libraries
First things first, let’s import the necessary libraries. We will import two libraries for this tutorial. First one is TensorFlow, which is the major library we will use. We will import tensorflow as tf, meaning that, for us to use tensorflow in our code, we won’t need to write ‘tensorflow’ each time, but we will simply use the alias of ‘tf’. This is kind of the default way to import tensorflow. We will also import matplotlib, which is a very popular data visualization library.

# import the necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
